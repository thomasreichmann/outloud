## Install

**On the Windows PC**, in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/thomasreichmann/outloud/releases/latest/download/install-windows.ps1 | iex
```

**On the Mac**, use **Set up a Mac…** in the tray menu, or in Terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/thomasreichmann/outloud/releases/latest/download/install-mac.sh | sh
```

The binaries are not code-signed. Both installers download with tools that do
not mark files as coming from the internet, so neither SmartScreen nor
Gatekeeper gets in the way. See the [README](https://github.com/thomasreichmann/outloud#readme)
for the zip download, uninstalling and troubleshooting.
